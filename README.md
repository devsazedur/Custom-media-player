# Custom-media-player
This is a custom media player. It's make with HTML5. I just customize it with CSS and Javascript. Here is a loader. It will display when video is loading. After that, the video will be play without sound. After click a button the video will be play with sound. When click the video it will be paused and show a button for play.
